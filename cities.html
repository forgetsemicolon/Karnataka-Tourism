            <h2>Bangalore</h2>
            <p>
                South India's most alive city is Bangalore. A melting point of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, the hoi polloi is charmingly mixed here. A bustling city today, Bangalore often reminisces about its days as a sleepy cantonment area of the British - tree lined avenues with quaint sounding names like Richmond Town and Victoria Layout hint that the city does get sentimental about its past. The Bangalore Palace, the Attara Kacheri (High Court), St. Mary’s Basilica, Tipu’s Palace, ISKCON Temple and the Bull Temple highlight Bangalore’s many personalities and are monuments that mark its journey, ante-IT.
                Now Bangalore is known for its thriving industry and as an IT hotbed. Lonely Planet rating the city as the No.3 destination in the Best Travel Cities in 2012 has made Bangalore an overnight star, if it wasn’t already. Almost at the heart of South India, this cosmopolitan city is everything a world city needs to be. Pleasant weather, pleasant people, pleasant hangouts. And for its people, being ‘Bangalored’ has a rather affectionate tone to it.

        <div class="Belgaum-section">
            <h2>Belgaum</h2>
            <p>
                Known as the land of heroes, of which Rani Chennamma of Kittur undoubtedly reigns supreme as the face of the sobriquet, Belgaum is one of Karnataka's oldest and largest cities. The romance of having a valourous queen, who fought to the finish against the British, still holds the people of Belgaum in its sway. A cornerstone of arts, culture, learning and industry, the city is all about location, location, location. Not only is it blessed with scenic natural environs, it also enjoys its own individual culture - essential Kannada culture spiced with Maharastrian and Goan influences. Considered as the state's second capital, Belgaum for long has been a vital industrial town courtesy its natural mineral deposits and is known across India for its foundries. Home to one of the biggest universities in the state, the people of Belgaum are articulate. A pivotal stop on the Jain circuit, Belgaum also has many touristy stops like the Belgaum fort, the Kittur Chennama Fort, Gokak Falls, the Doodh Sagar Falls, the gothic-styled St. Mary's Church and the Kapileshwar Temple. Do be sure to taste the famous Belgaum Kunda, a sweet delicacy and the renowned Gokak toys and pottery.

        <div class="Bellary-section">
            <h2>Bellary</h2>
            <p>
                 Bellary has seen a long line of rulers - the Mauryas, the Satavahanas, the Pallavas, the Kadambas, the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Kalyani Chalukyans, the Southern Kalachuryas, the Sevuna Yadavas, the Hoysalas, and the Cholas including in more recent times, the heads of the state. So it comes as no surprise that Bellary, despite being a progressive industrial district, still has the airs and graces of a forgotten time. It's stark, rocky landscape acts as a dramatic backdrop to time's eternal tableau at Hampi. The erstwhile capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, Hampi holds court as the Golden Era: fourteenth and fifteen century edifices shrug a casual shoulder at time and look like they plan on being around for a good many centuries, like they've done so far. The Bellary Fort, as a sort of reconfirmation that time does stand still in these parts, likewise stands sentinel upon the Ballari Gudda as it has stood for centuries. It's perhaps, this trick of time that inspires Bellary to stay true to the memory of what it has been than what it can be.

        <div class="Hubli-section">
            <h2>Hubli</h2>
            <p>
                For a commercial and business hub, Hubli's name translates into sheer poetry. Hubli comes from 'Hubbali' which means flowering creeper, and from literature to industry, much has blossomed forth from this city. Hubli shares much of its spotlight with Dharward, its twin city. An upcoming industrial centre, Hubli enjoys the benefits of having been strategically located. Positioned exactly in between the Deccan Plateau and the forested hills of the Malenadu region, Hubli's ideal locale is further whetted by Dharwad's clout as a seat of learning. As much as it's poised to take on a more significant role in the commercial world, Hubli's proximity to some of Karnataka's most scenic and wild neighbourhoods, makes it what you would call idyllic. The Sakrebyle Elephant Camp is one such stop.

        <div class="Mangalore-section">
            <h2>Mangalore</h2>
            <p>
               Ensconced on the coast, this maritime city makes a pleasant and convenient stop between Goa and Kerala. With its narrow, winding streets fringed with coconut palms, quaint houses with terracotta-tiled roofs, beautiful beaches, temples and churches, and the aroma of spicy coconut curries, it has preserved its old-world charm. Mangalore was a major seaport and ship-building centre in Hyder Ali's time. Today it is a business and commercial centre and Karnataka's major port for the export of coffee, spices and cashew. The Someshwar Temple overlooking a rocky promontory, the ancient 10th century Mangala Devi Temple dedicated to the Goddess Mangala Devi, and the 11th century Kadri Manjunatha Temple with its exquisite bronze images of Lokeshwara co-exist with splendid churches and mosques.

        <div class="Mysore-section">
            <h2>Mysore</h2>
            <p>
                Mysore is yet to, and perhaps will never, get over its past. A past that’s made of kings, queens, conquests, rich patrons, extravagant durbars and pearled hallways must be hard to get over. The streets in Mysore are old and a good part of history can be traced by following their winding paths. The city that gets its name from Mahishasura, the troublemaker demon who was slain by the Goddess Chamundeshwari: whose temple atop the Chamundi Hill watches all over the city has played host to the reign of a long line of Wadiyars, Tipu Sultan and the British Raj.
                All roads in Mysore lead to the Mysore Palace, and rightfully so. An ode to magnificence, the Mysore Palace is a marvel of ornate ceilings, jewelled corridors, open mandaps, stained glass windows, vivid paintings and Wadiyar memorabilia - including the jewelled throne. As the main host of the famous Mysore Dasara, the Palace still has the airs of the headquarters of a sovereign. Mysore's other palaces include the Jaganmohana Palace, Rajendra Vilas, Lalitha Mahal (which is now the Lalith Mahal Palace Hotel) and the Jayalakshmi Vilas.
