The Tours and Travel Management System is a web based application. The main purpose of “Tours and travels management system” is to provide a convenient way for a customer to look at the places he can visit, the availability of hotels for accommodation, recreational activities to do at a particular place. The objective of this project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel agency. In this project, we will make an easier task of searching places and ways of commute within each city. In the present system a customer has to approach various agencies to find details of places and to find out about the place. This often requires a lot of time and effort. We provide approach skills to critically examine how a tourist visits and its ability to operate in an appropriate way when dealing with the consequences of tourism, locally, regionally, and nationally including visitor security and ecological influences. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly. The project ‘Tours and Travels Management System’ is developed to replace the currently existing system.
